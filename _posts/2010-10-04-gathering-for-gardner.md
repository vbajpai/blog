The Gathering for Gardner Dragon is an example of Hollow Face Illusion
in which the concave (hollow) face appears to be convex. Human beings
have a strong bias towards convex shapes, so much so that they overcome
lightening, shadow and stereoscopic cues. This is the reason why the
illusion is more pronounced when one eye is closed or using a camera
lens. The bias towards convex face is because of the strong connectivity
between top and bottom parts of our brain and how the top part can
sometimes dominate the bottom part. The bottom part is responsible for
capturing sensory information and the top part for processing that
information. In this example, when we move around to see the object from
different angles, the top part uses the past learning experience to
create a hypothesis which overpowers the actual sensory data received
from the bottom part making us believe the object is staring at us.
